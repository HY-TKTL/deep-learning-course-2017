    "The task is to learn to assign the correct labels to news articles.  The corpus contains ~850K articles from Reuters.  The test set is about 10% of the articles. The data is unextracted in XML files.\n",

    "We're only giving you the code for downloading the data, and how to save the final model. The rest you'll have to do yourselves.\n",

    "Some comments and hints particular to the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One document may belong to many classes in this problem, i.e., it's a multi-label classification problem. In fact there are documents that don't belong to any class, and you should also be able to handle these correctly. Pay careful attention to how you design the outputs of the network (e.g., what activation to use) and what loss function should be used.\n",
    "- You may use word-embeddings to get better results. For example, you were already using a smaller version of the GloVE  embeddings in exercise 4. Do note that these embeddings take a lot of memory, but if you use the keras.embedding layer, it will be more efficient. \n",
    "- Loading all documents into one big matrix as we have done in the exercises is not feasible (e.g. the virtual servers in CSC have only 3 GB of RAM). You need to load the documents in smaller chunks for the training. This shouldn't be a problem, as we are doing mini-batch training anyway, and thus we don't need to keep all the documents in memory. You can simply pass you current chunk of documents to `model.fit()` as it remembers the weights from the previous run.\n"
